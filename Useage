## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Initialize the Environment
Set up your skill registry and create the standardized project structure.
```bash
python skill_init.py --name "credit_risk_assessment"
2. Extract Expert Knowledge
Launch the interactive Interviewer Agent. Answer the strategic questions to define decision chains, risk thresholds, and business constraints. This automatically generates the SKILL.md logic file.
python expert_interviewer.py --skill "credit_risk_assessment"
3. Scan & Refactor Existing Code
Identify complex business calculations or repetitive financial logic in your current codebase and encapsulate them into the Skill's tools/ directory.
python scan_code.py --source "./legacy_fin_scripts" --target "credit_risk_assessment"
4. Compile into AI Tools
Convert the expert logic and Python tools into a format that AI Agents (like Claude) can call directly.
python skill_compiler.py --skill "credit_risk_assessment"
